## Mattermost Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for automating builds, deployments, and so on.

- [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com) â€” Send Mattermost messages. Fork/inspired from https://github.com/apex/actions/tree/master/slack


You need generate a `mattermost.json` file in a step before.
For the message format you can check the [Mattermost documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html)

Also you can check the files for example:
